## Datasets


- The directory tree should look like this:
  ```
  Coming soon
  ```
  (It may be a bit confusing because directories with the same name appears...)
- ESC-50: Dataset for Environmental Sound Classification https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YDEPUT
  - Download audio files and put them in the directory "ESC50" indluced in the above dataset at figshare
  - Note: our code is built for the older version of ESC-50 with ogg format, in which folder organizations are slightly different from the current version at https://github.com/karoldvl/ESC-50
- TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S1
  - Download audio files and put them in the directory "TIMIT" indluced in the above dataset at figshare
